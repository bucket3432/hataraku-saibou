If we stand hand in hand and put on a smile
Every tear will be filled with light

On the days when we overflow with happiness
Our pulse hurries up to match the pace
Though the world marches on and changes bit by bit
If we're together, we can take it on
Let's go run ahead with all our energy
All the way to the door to a new dawn

Hello, precious days
Lucky, lucky days
Fight on, fight on, 'til we reach our goal, give it our all
Hello, special days
Happy, happy days
Fight on, fight on, all that we ever do gives our world its form
If we stand hand in hand and put on a smile
Every tear will be filled with light
And then when we do, would you come with me?

With me

With me

With me

With me
