Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

As we wake up every day, there's no time to waste, come on
Gotta hurry, dash and scurry, all our work won't finish itself

Keep on going when we fail, always pushing forward
And giving it our all until at last we get a moment for tea time
And though our rest is short, we head on out once more
But I still hope that I'll see you again (again, again, again)
'Cause I wanna get stronger again!

I wonder what'll go on today? (What'll go on today?)
While we're out in the fray (While we're out in the fray)
Everybody go! (Yeah!) Do the best you can! (Yeah!)
So that we can have a peaceful future
Doing what's in my sight (Doing what's in my sight)
What I believe is right (What I believe is right)
No one left to cry, no one has to die
We're the greatest team, the Cells at Work
(Though we're all different kinds) We have a single purpose
(When we all come gather 'round) We have a single purpose
It's a fiesta, all about Cells at Work!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, hey, let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, hey, let's go!
